<h2>About me</h2>
<hr>

<p>I'm a freelance illustrator trying to become a front-end developer. I have almost 0 experience at front-end web development. But a big desire to learn and to understand what's under the hood of the profession keeps pushing me further. You have to be flexible to fit in the world today. Developing marketable skills and expanding the range of tools helps me in achieving my goals.<br>

Objective: To leverage my years of illustration experience, marketing skills and my innate desire for order in a front-end developer role at your company.<br>

Years of freelance work tought me to do the job. Patience, persistence and hard work are my strengths.</p>
